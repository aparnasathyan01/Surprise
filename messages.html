           Happyyyy Birthdayyyy bro! They say every tall person needs a short friend and vice versa but I say every naive person needs a friend who is bold, fearless and funny to bring out the best in them. And for me, youâ€™re definitely that friend. Wish you nothing but the best of everything, always! Hereâ€™s to another year of being silly and laughing our asses off for no reasonðŸ¥‚

           Vidhi, pidhi,bro ,chaddi buddy, sister from another mister you are 19 now ,
           Still you are as small to me like the first time we met sweet ,caring , competitive and funny. You have always been there in my dark times and also in my awkward ones . No doubt I can bear your jokes on shit and stuff. Your long pov and stories 
           Your artistic brain and your funny dreams
           Nothing has changed. Its just you grew jk
           We have fought over silly things but we never said a single no to a night stay I mean being apart from you sounds boring.
           I wish all your dreams come true ( please dont think about kookie)and stay like the way you are .

           Happy Birthday Chibi!! Being a man of few words, I haven't got much for your birthday wish. But, let's continue our chemistry (group study one XD) and TEACHER-STUDENT relationship (IYKWIM).
